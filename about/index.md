title: About me

Hi, I'm Pepe Berba GMON, CCSK. 

I write about stats, security, and cryptography. I've been bouncing back and forth between cybersecurity and machine learning for the past few years. In my free-time, I practice penetration testing and forensics, and I'm targetting to get an OSCP in the future.

I'm a hobbyist cryptographer. I've had a few units of cryptography and number theory in college and some experience solving crypto challenges in CTFs. Nothing serious.


Background 
----------

I'm currently a Cloud Security Engineer and an ex-Machine Learning Researcher at [Thinking Machines Data
Science](https://thinkingmachin.es/), a data science startup in the Philippines. I'm also trying to finish my masters degree in data science from the University of the Philippines, School of Statistics.

Previously, I worked in a Redrock IT Security, a cybersecurity startup based in the Philippines. I was part of the founding team of the SOC and had to wear many hats: deploying SIEMs from scratch using ELK, developing integrations and custom scripts for the operations, configuring rules and alerts for threat detection, and monitoring and analyzing alerts.


Certifications 
==============

GMON, CSSK, Google Cloud Professional Cloud Security Engineer, and Elastic Certified Engineer

=============


When I'm free, I try to solve crypto challenges in CTFs with the <a href="https://hackstreetboys.ph/"> hackstreetboys </a>.

My write-ups are in my [ctf-solutions](https://github.com/pberba/ctf-solutions) repository, but I will try to migrate some of them in the [crypto](/crypto) section.

Competitive Programming
=======================

I used to do Competitive Programming back in college. I mainly did problems on data structures and dynamic programming. [(UVa Online Judge Profile)](https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org/id/103254)
